# TwitterBob-Omb

This does precisely one thing, and that is delete all your Tweets.
In the true spirit of Dev-Jankâ„¢, it's thrown together with speed (of implementation) in mind.

Uses Twitter's OAuth1.0a flow with out-of-band (PIN) login - no callback URLs here.

Do what you want with it. Currently requires API keys to be in the code - you'll need your own if you want to make use of this code.
I'll think about releasing a compiled binary with my own API keys for people to use, but not for the moment.

Thanks for stopping by.
